PartyPlayer's purpose is to create a playlist for the user. Users can choose to enter their favorite song, artist or genre to base the playlist off of. This app takes the hassle out of trying to curate a playlist by doing so with just the click of a button. Then hop on spotify and get the music going fresh out of your new playlist.
